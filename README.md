# Weather App Tutorial

Welcome to the Weather App tutorial! In this tutorial, we'll learn how to build a simple weather application using React and the OpenWeatherMap API. This tutorial is designed for beginners who are just starting with React and want to learn how to fetch data from an API.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Node.js installed on your computer

## Technologies Used

We'll be using the following technologies for this tutorial:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: A free API for accessing weather data from cities around the world [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling for React

## Step 1: Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/umakant3525/Weather_app_IT_Tech.git
```
If you don't have Git installed, you can also download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:
```bash 
cd Weather_app_IT_Tech
npm install
```

## Step 3: Get an API Key
To fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, you'll need an API key. You can sign up for a free API key on the OpenWeatherMap website.

## Step 4: Replace API Key
Replace const apiKey = "your_api_key"; in the App.jsx file with your API key.

## Step 5: Run Your Project
Run the project:
```bash
npm run dev
```
