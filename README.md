# Weather App Tutorial

Welcome to the Weather App tutorial! In this tutorial, we'll learn how to build a simple weather application using React and the OpenWeatherMap API. This tutorial is designed for beginners who are just starting with React and want to learn how to fetch data from an API.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Node.js installed on your computer

## Technologies Used

We'll be using the following technologies for this tutorial:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: A free API for accessing weather data from cities around the world
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling for React projects

## Getting Started

If you don't have Git installed, you can also download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd weather-app
npm install
Step 3: Get an API Key
To fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, you'll need an API key. You can sign up for a free API key on the OpenWeatherMap website.

Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add your API key:

makefile
Copy code
VITE_REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Replace your_api_key_here with your actual API key.

Step 5: Start the Development Server
Once you've set up your API key, start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the application on http://localhost:3000, and you should see the Weather App running in your browser.
